        </li>
        <br />
        <li>

        <li>
          Jett - Representing her home country of South Korea, Jett's agile and

        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Kay/O - KAY/O is a machine of war built for a single purpose:

          ultimate edge.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Killjoy - The genius of Germany. Killjoy secures the battlefield with
          ease using her arsenal of inventions. If the damage from her gear

          of them.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Omen - A phantom of a memory, Omen hunts in the shadows. He renders

          hold as his foe scrambles to learn where he might strike next.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>

          in his fighting style, igniting the battlefield with flash and flare.
          Whether he's got backup or not, he'll rush into a fight on his own
          terms.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Raze - Raze explodes out of Brazil with her big personality and big
          guns. With her blunt-force-trauma playstyle, she excels at flushing
          entrenched enemies and clearing tight spaces with a generous dose of
          “boom.”
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Reyna - Forged in the heart of Mexico, Reyna dominates single combat,
          popping off with each kill she scores. Her capability is only limited
          by her raw skill, making her highly dependent on performance.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Skye - Hailing from Australia, Skye and her band of beasts trail-blaze
          the way through hostile territory. With her creations hampering the
          enemy, and her power to heal others, the team is strongest and safest
          by Skye’s side.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Sova - Born from the eternal winter of Russia's tundra, Sova tracks,
          finds, and eliminates enemies with ruthless efficiency and precision.
          His custom bow and incredible scouting abilities ensure that even if
          you run, you cannot hide.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Viper - The American chemist, Viper deploys an array of poisonous
          chemical devices to control the battlefield and cripple the enemy's
          vision. If the toxins don't kill her prey, her mind games surely will.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Yoru - Japanese native, Yoru, rips holes straight through reality to
          infiltrate enemy lines unseen. Using deception and aggression in equal
          measure, he gets the drop on each target before they know where to
          look.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Fade - Turkish bounty hunter, Fade, unleashes the power of raw
          nightmares to seize enemy secrets. Attuned with terror itself, she
          hunts targets and reveals their deepest fears—before crushing them in
          the dark.
